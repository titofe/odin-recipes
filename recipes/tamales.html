    <h3>Description</h3>
    <textarea name="Tamales" id="recipes" cols="100" rows="5">These tamales are delicious! I have been looking for a good tamales recipe for years. One day I went to the international market and stood in the Mexican aisle until a woman with a full cart came by. I just asked her if she knew how to make tamales. This is her recipe with a few additions from me! This is great served with refried beans and a salad.</textarea>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Filling:
          <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds pork loin</li>
            <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>Chile Sauce:
          <ul>
            <li>4 dried chile peppers</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>Husks and Dough:
          <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks</li>
            <li>⅔ cup lard</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Make the filling: Place pork, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until pork is cooked through, about 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make chile sauce: Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
    <li>Transfer chiles and cooking water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup chile sauce. Reserve remaining sauce for serving.</li>
    <li>Prepare husks and dough: Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water until softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablespoon broth until fluffy. Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a spongy dough.</li>
    <li>Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over husks to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.</li>
    <li>Place 1 tablespoon pork filling over center of each. Fold the sides, top, and bottom of each husk in toward the center to enclose dough.</li>
    <li>Arrange tamales in a steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauce and top with sour cream, or mix sour cream into chile sauce first for a creamy sauce.</li>
